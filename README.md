# SneakerPark Project - Data Governance Nanodegree 
In this project, I help SneakerPark, an online shoe reseller, implementing data governance solutions using the knowledge you have learned from this course.

Implemented data governance solutions for an online shoe reseller SneakerPark to better manage their data
now and in the future. First, I created an enterprise data model that provides a holistic view of all
the data in their systems. I documented the metadata in an enterprise data catalog and profile the
data in their systems to identify data quality issues, suggest remediation strategies for each of these issues,
and design a data quality dashboard. Finally, I sketch out a proposed MDM implementation
architecture, define a set of matching rules for the creation of customer and item master data, and define the
data governance roles and responsibilities that are necessary to oversee this data governance initiative.
